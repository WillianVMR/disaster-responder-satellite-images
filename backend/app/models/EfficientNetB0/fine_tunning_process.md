Explanation:
Shared Base Model:

Instead of creating two separate instances of EfficientNetB0, a shared instance is created.
Features from both pre and post-disaster images are extracted using the same base model, which avoids duplicate layer names.
Model Creation:

The input tensors for pre and post-disaster images are defined.
The same base model is used to process both inputs.
Features from both branches are concatenated and fed into additional layers for final classification.
